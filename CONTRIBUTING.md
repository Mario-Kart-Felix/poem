I apologize for the earlier incomplete response. Here's the complete answer:

`CONTRIBUTING.md` is a file typically found in open-source software projects hosted on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. The file serves as a guide for contributors who want to contribute to the project by providing instructions on how to get started, how to submit a pull request, how to report issues, and any other relevant information.

The purpose of `CONTRIBUTING.md` is to ensure that contributors follow a consistent workflow and provide high-quality contributions that align with the project's standards and guidelines. It also helps maintainers and contributors communicate effectively and avoid misunderstandings or conflicts.

The contents of `CONTRIBUTING.md` can vary depending on the project and its requirements, but some common sections include:

- Introduction: A brief overview of the project and its purpose.

- Getting started: Instructions on how to set up the project and its dependencies.

- How to contribute: Guidelines on how to contribute, including how to report issues, how to submit a pull request, and how to communicate with maintainers and other contributors.

- Code of conduct: A set of rules and guidelines that contributors are expected to follow to ensure a respectful and inclusive environment for everyone involved in the project.

- Style guide: Standards and guidelines for writing code, documentation, and other contributions to ensure consistency and readability.

- License: Information about the project's license and how it affects contributions.

By providing clear and concise instructions, `CONTRIBUTING.md` can encourage more people to contribute to a project and help ensure that their contributions are valuable and useful.
