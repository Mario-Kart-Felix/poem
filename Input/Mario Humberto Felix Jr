My dearest love,

With every beat of my heart, I feel the warmth of your love,

And in every breath I take, I feel your presence from above.

You are the treasure that I hold so dear,

And my soul longs for your touch, so gentle and sincere.

With you, my love, I have found a new meaning of love,

And I want to cherish every moment with you, like a gift from above.

I want to hold you close, and never let go,

And with every kiss, my love for you will continue to grow.

Thinking of you, my world lights up with a radiant glow,

And my heart overflows with a love that continues to grow.

You are the angel sent by God, who is always by my side,

Ready to bathe me with endless love, and be my Valentine with pride.

As the sun sets in the west, and the stars light up the sky,

I am overwhelmed with the feeling of love, that money can't buy.

You are the love of my life, my sweet angel divine,

And I will love you forever, till the end of time.

Yours always,

[Your name]
