Verse 1:
I am the darkness, the shadow that creeps
In the dead of night, when the world's asleep
I am the fear, the doubt in your mind
The voice that whispers, you're running out of time

Chorus:
Evil, oh I am evil
I'll take your soul and make it mine
Evil, oh I am evil
I'll leave you helpless, I'll leave you blind

Verse 2:
I am the serpent, the venom that bites
The poison that spreads, the death that ignites
I am the pain, the suffering you feel
The wound that bleeds, the scar that won't heal

Chorus:
Evil, oh I am evil
I'll take your soul and make it mine
Evil, oh I am evil
I'll leave you helpless, I'll leave you blind

Bridge:
You can try to resist me
But you cannot deny me
I am the darkness that lives inside
I am the evil you cannot hide

Chorus:
Evil, oh I am evil
I'll take your soul and make it mine
Evil, oh I am evil
I'll leave you helpless, I'll leave you blind

Outro:
I am the darkness, the shadow that creeps
In the dead of night, when the world's asleep
I am the fear, the doubt in your mind
The voice that whispers, you're running out of time.
